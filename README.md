# data-science-projects
basic to intermediate data science projects. Files in this repo are as follows:

1. Exploratory data analysis - Loan defaulter analysis
2. Multiple linear regression - predicting demand for shared bikes
3. Logistic regression model - identifying potential leads, who are more likely to take up the course provided by the educational institution
4. K-means and Hierarchical clustering model - identifying countries in urgent need of aid from an NGO
