• HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of
backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

• After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how
to use this money strategically and effectively.

• The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of
aid.


**AIM:**

1. Identify top countries that are in severe need of aid
2. Categorize them based on health and socio-economic factors
3. Suggest top ten countries that needs to be focussed

**SOLUTION**

Use clustering approach to categorize countries based on socio-economic and health factors.

**ANALYSIS APPROACH**

The dataset is called “Country-data.csv”(here after referred to as “cntry”)

***Below are the steps followed for analysis:***

✓ Understanding the Dataset - Reading the dataset, doing basic checks like datatypes of each column, shape, and statistical description of numerical columns.

✓ Data Cleaning and preparation - Involves checking null/missing values, changed values of three columns from % of GDP to
actual GDP

✓ Univariate Analysis - Distribution of continuous variables was analyzed using distribution plot, boxplot and statistical
description.

✓ Bivariate Analysis - Discovering patterns between two variables which involved Continuous to Continuous – e.g. Scatter
plot

✓ Multivariate Analysis – heatmap was plotted to analyze correlation

✓ Scaling data and Hopkins score

✓ K means clustering approach – elbow curve and silhouette score methods were performed, cluster profiling and
visualization was done.

✓ Hierarchical approach – single and complete linkage methods were done, cluster profiling and visualization was done

✓ Concluded with the list of top ten countries that need aid immediately.
