Challenge:

The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent
credit history.
Consider a scenario where Mr. X is applying for loan in a bank .There are two possible errors that the bank
can commit.
1. Credit loss: Bank will approve loan of Mr. X who could be a possible defaulter there by incurring loss of
entire credit amount.
2. Interest loss : Bank rejects loan request of Mr. X who can make timely payments there by losing a good
customer and interest on loan amount.

SOLUTION

This case study aims to identify patterns using EDA, from existing data available about the clients and past
loan history of the clients. These patterns will provide insights, if client could be a possible loan defaulter and
helps bank to take actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending ( to risky applicants)
at a higher interest rate, etc

DATASETS

1. Application Dataset - The current information of the customer.

2. Previous Application Dataset – The information about the previous loan data.



ANALYSIS APPROACH

✓ Understanding the Dataset - Reading the dataset, doing basic checks like datatypes of each column, shape, statistical
description of numerical columns.

✓ Data Cleaning - Involves checking null/missing values ,fixing incorrect datatypes, analyzing the outliers and binning of
continuous variables.

✓ Univariate Analysis - Distribution of continuous variables and count of categorical variables.

✓ Bivariate Analysis - Discovering patterns between two variables which involve:
1. Categorical and categorical
2. Continuous to Continuous
3. Categorical to Continuous

✓ Multivariate Analysis - Using more than two variables to discover trends between features.

✓ Deriving conclusions - Getting insights.
